This app is supposed to do the following:
## Purpose
This app allows users to help their fellow citizens. The app has a predefined list of
resources that people mght need, and connects people who have a surplus to people
who have a shortage. For example, tinned fish or R12 airtime vouchers might be a
resource.
## Features
### MVP: Core Features (80% of the App)
### Donor and Recipient Database:
- Users should be able to sign up, and any user can donate and receive
items.
- Users should be able to write a short biography of themselves as a
motivation for items that they are in need of, and contact details so that
the donation can actually happen
- User donation and receipt history should be available
Donation System:
- Potential Recipients should be able to enter in a list of products that they
need along with the amounts that they need.
- When a user indicates what they want to donate, the system will present a
list of users who could use those items, and allow the user to allocate an
amount of items to that person.
- This should decrease the amount that person needs as well as the
amount the donor has available.
## Enhancements: Additional Features (20% of the App)
### Leaderboard System:
- The app should show a leaderboard indicating the most prolific donors.
This should be based on the total number of items they have donated
- The system should allow a user to share their ranking on WhatsApp or
other platforms using the “Share” function on Android.
